The analytical model in Wolfram Mathematica for the calculation of efficiencies from metallic spheres for a linearly polarized wave plane wave. Drude model (local response approximation) and Thomas-Fermi models for the dielectric response are considered. The medium outside of the sphere is air with permittivity. The number of spherical harmonics is set to m = 25.
